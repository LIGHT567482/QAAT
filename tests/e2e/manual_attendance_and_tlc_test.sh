# Three things, end to end against a running stack.
#
#   1. THE TLC OWNS ONE DEPARTMENT'S TIMETABLE, and staffs it. They place the hours AND name the
#      lecturers — the two halves of the same job, which used to sit on two desks, so a timetable
#      got published with blank slots while the TLC waited for someone else to fill them. Bounded
#      to their own department; the administrator keeps the institution.
#
#   2. THE TIMETABLE IS READABLE FROM EVERY OVERSIGHT DASHBOARD. It is the schedule every
#      attendance figure is measured against, and a number whose baseline you cannot see is a
#      number you cannot check.
#
#   3. MANUAL ATTENDANCE for a lecture that was taught but never timetabled. The round is
#      generated FROM the timetable, so a monitor standing in front of an untimetabled lecture
#      could previously record nothing, or tick whichever slot looked closest — filing a true
#      observation under the wrong lecture. Every field picks from a list or accepts typing, and
#      the assertions below cover BOTH paths, because the whole point is the lecture the
#      curriculum has not heard of yet.
#
