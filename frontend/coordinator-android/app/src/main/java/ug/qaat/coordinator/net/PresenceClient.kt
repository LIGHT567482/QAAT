 * The two cloud calls behind the lecturer's "I was here" button.

 * Neither is on the critical path of filing a claim, and that is the design rather than an
 * accident. The button works with the phone in flight mode: the timetable it matches against was
 * cached the last time there was signal, and the claim it writes goes into Room and is uploaded
 * whenever the network comes back. A lecturer disputing a monitor tick is, almost by definition,
 * someone who had no signal in that room at that time.
