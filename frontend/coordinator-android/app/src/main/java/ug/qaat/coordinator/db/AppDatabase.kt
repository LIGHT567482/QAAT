 * cache held whatever day it was last refreshed on, so a monitor who last had signal on Monday
 * searched Monday's timetable on Tuesday and was told, with no hint of trouble, that lectures were
 * where they had been the day before.
 *
 * patrol_slots is REBUILT rather than altered: its primary key gains dayOfWeek AND offeringId,
 * which SQLite cannot add in place. The offering matters for a second, independent reason — two
 * cohorts can run the same unit at the same hour in different rooms, and without it in the key one
 * of those lectures overwrote the other, so the monitor could never find it. The rows are
 * dropped, not copied: they are a cache of one stale day, the next refresh replaces them
 * wholesale, and copying them would carry that stale day across the very upgrade meant to end it.
 * Nothing the monitor RECORDED lives here; patrol_logs, the queue of unsynced ticks, is
