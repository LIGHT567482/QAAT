/**
 * "I was here." The lecturer's own record of a moment the QA monitor also records.
 *
 * A monitor tick is one person's account, timestamped and filed against a named lecturer, and until
 * now it was the only account there was. A lecturer teaching in a room the monitor never reached
 * could answer only with their word, days later, against a record made at the time. This is a
 * record made at the time by the other party.
 *
 * EVERYTHING HERE WORKS WITH NO NETWORK, which is the whole point — the rooms where this is needed
 * are the rooms with no signal, and a lecturer who could have reached the server at the time would
 * not be having this argument. GPS is a satellite fix, not an internet lookup. The timetable it
 * matches against was cached the last time there was signal. The claim goes into the encrypted
 * local database and uploads later.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS AND IS NOT. A phone reports the coordinates it is handed, and someone determined can
 * hand it false ones. This is evidence, not proof, and nothing in the system treats it as proof:
 * it does not overturn a monitor tick, mark attendance, or feed a report. Its worth is that it is
 * CONTEMPORANEOUS and SPECIFIC — a claim filed at 14:07 at a fixed point, matched to the 14:00
 * slot, is a different object from a recollection offered a week later.
