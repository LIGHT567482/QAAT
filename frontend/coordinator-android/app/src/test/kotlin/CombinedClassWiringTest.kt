/**
 * THE WIRING BETWEEN THE TIMETABLE AND THE CODE — which is where this feature can go wrong quietly.
 *
 * The derivation itself is already pinned on both sides: CombinedClassCodeTest checks the Kotlin,
 * combinedclass_test.go checks the Go, and the two agree on shared vectors. None of that helps if
 * the phone feeds the derivation the wrong slot, or derives a code for a lecture that isn't shared.
 * Both failures are invisible in a unit test of the hash and obvious only in a hall — a lecturer
 * reads out three digits that open nobody's register, or a coordinator is shown a code field for an
 * ordinary lecture and wonders what number they are supposed to be waiting for.
 *
 * These tests cover exactly that seam.
