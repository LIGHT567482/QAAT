/**
 * EVERY REPORT THE DIRECTORATE CAN PRODUCE, ON ONE PAGE.
 *
 * The reports themselves were never missing — student attendance, lecturer attendance, the monitor
 * record, lecturer teaching, exam eligibility and now patrol coverage all existed, and all of them
 * export. What was missing was any single place that said so. They were scattered across the
 * sidebar under names describing the SCREEN rather than the QUESTION, so producing a report meant
 * already knowing which page happened to hold it.
 *
 * So each entry below leads with the question it answers, and says plainly what formats come out.
 * Nothing here is a new capability except where marked — this is a map, and the value is entirely
 * in not having to hold the map in your head.
