/**
 * THE OVERVIEW'S CHARTS, shared by every oversight role: the DQA director, the VC, the tenant
 * admin, QA monitors, deans and heads of department.
 *
 * One component for all of them because the DATA is already one endpoint: /api/v1/org/analytics
 * resolves the caller's own college or department from their account, so a dean's charts cover
 * their college and the directorate's cover the institution without either page knowing which.
 * VC, ADMIN and QA_MONITOR sit in the same reader set (orgDashRoles) and see the institution
 * whole — the monitor when no college is assigned, the others always.
 *
 * WHY THESE THREE FORMS. Each was chosen from the job the reader has, not from a wish for variety:
 *
 *   Line — direction. "Is this getting better or worse" is a question about time, and a scalar
 *          cannot answer it. Two series, both percentages, so they share ONE axis; a second y-scale
 *          would invent a correlation that is not in the data.
 *   Bar  — location. "Where is the problem" is a comparison across departments (or units, for a
 *          head of one), and a bar is the form people read most accurately.
 *   Pie  — composition. The term's lectures split three ways, at a glance. Three slices, direct
 *          percentages, because a pie is only honest for part-to-whole with few segments.
 *
 * COLOR IS ASSIGNED BY JOB AND WAS VALIDATED, NOT EYEBALLED. The line's two series and the pie's
 * three slices use categorical slots 1–3 (blue / orange / aqua), which pass the colorblind
 * separation, lightness-band, chroma and contrast checks in both light and dark mode — the pie
 * against the all-pairs list, since a reader compares any two slices, not just neighbours.
 *
 * An earlier draft coloured the pie green-for-taught and red-for-not-taught, which is the obvious
 * choice and wrong: that pair measures ΔE 4.1 under deuteranopia — the two commonest slices of the
 * chart would have been the same colour for a reader with red-green colour blindness. It is exactly
 * the mistake that looks fine to the person drawing it.
 *
 * The bar chart is ONE colour for every bar. Shading bars darker-where-taller double-encodes the
 * length the reader can already see, and spends the only free channel on nothing.

// adjacent CVD ΔE 9.1 light / 8.4 dark (yellow↔aqua), clear of the ≥8 target in both modes.

            Support staff clock in and out at a terminal, and the four ways a day can end are not
            degrees of one failure — arriving late, leaving early and not coming at all are three
            different problems with three different remedies. A single "attendance %" per
            department hides which one is happening, so each day is classified into exactly one
            bucket and the buckets are shown side by side.

            STACKED, not grouped: the four buckets are parts of one whole (every working day is
            exactly one of them), and the stack lets a reader see both the composition within a
            department and the total days worked across departments. Grouped bars would show the
            same four numbers while throwing away the fact that they sum to something meaningful.

            2px surface-coloured gap between segments so adjacent fills never touch — abutting
            colours read as one blended mark, which is the failure a stacked bar is most prone to.

            Direct labels are REQUIRED here, not decorative: two of these four colours sit below
            3:1 contrast on the light surface, and the validator's relief rule says such a palette
            ships with visible labels or a table view. The on-time percentage is printed at the end
            of every bar. */}
