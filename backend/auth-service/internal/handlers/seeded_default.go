// Students, lecturers and QA patrollers do not choose a password when their account is made — they
// are added by registration number, staff ID, or by an administrator, and the system seeds a known
// first-login one that they must replace immediately. That word has been written down in two
// casings over the life of the system ("Student" when the seeding migrations ran, "student" in the
// docs handed to staff and in everything created since), so a perfectly correct default was being
// typed and rejected.
//
// The word is always the role: student → "student", lecturer → "lecturer", patroller →
// "patroller". Nothing to look up and nothing to be told twice.
//
// seededDefaults lists every casing that has ever been seeded, grouped by the word people are told
// to type. Order matters only for speed.
//
// Two of these words carry history:
//
//   - "patroller" and "monitor" are the SAME role. The QA patrol role was seeded as "patroller"
//     (migration 058 era), renamed along with its dashboard, and has been seeded as "monitor"
//     since. Telling the person the current word must open the older accounts, and vice-versa, so
//     the two keys carry both words — an account holding either seed opens for whichever word its
//     owner was told.
//   - "coordinator" is a coordinator's first-login word: an administrator creates the account and
//     the coordinator signs in once with the role's name, forced to replace it before the session
//     flow will open.
//   - "staff" is the bulk-import floor ([ImportedPasswordFor] in the gateway): an imported
//     ADMIN, VC, dean, HOD or QA-role account that went in with a sheet rather than a chosen
//     password is seeded to "staff" and forced to change it on first sign-in.

// matchesSeededDefault reports whether `submitted` is a case-variant of the account's OWN, still
// untouched, seeded default password.
//
// This is deliberately narrow, and each condition is load-bearing:
//
//   - The account must still be flagged force_password_change. The instant the user picks a real
//     password that flag clears, and from then on their password is compared exactly like anyone
//     else's. Nothing here relaxes matching for a chosen password.
//   - The stored hash must itself verify against one of the known seeded spellings. That is proof
//     the account is genuinely sitting on a factory default rather than on a user's choice that
//     happens to resemble one.
//   - Only the word the account was actually seeded with is considered — "student" never opens an
//     account seeded with "lecturer".
//
// So the only extra password ever accepted is a different capitalisation of a password that is
// public knowledge anyway, on an account that cannot reach any role UI before changing it.
