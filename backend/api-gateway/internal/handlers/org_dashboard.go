//
// SCOPE IS NOT A PARAMETER. Every one of these roles is bounded by org units carried on their own
// account: HOD and QA_DEPT_REP by `users.department`, DEAN by `users.school`, and QA_MONITOR by the
// schools an admin assigned them (qa_monitor_schools, migration 110). The caller cannot name a
// different unit — there is no query parameter for it — so a dean cannot read another college by
// asking nicely. A QA monitor with no schools assigned reads the institution-wide view until an
// admin assigns some. The institution-wide roles (DQA, VC/DVC, ADMIN) get the unscoped view of the
// same data, which is what makes /org/at-risk one page rather than four.
//
// An account with a BLANK org unit matches nothing rather than everything. That is the whole reason
// the admin form refuses to create one without it: an empty scope that matched every department
// would quietly hand a head of one department the whole institution.
