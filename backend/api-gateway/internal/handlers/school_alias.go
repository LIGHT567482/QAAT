// One school, two names — and both have to match.
//
// A college has a formal title ("School of Mathematics and Computing") and the short form everyone
// actually uses ("SOMAC"). Migration 072 stores both. This file is the single place that knows they
// are the same thing.
//
// WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN A LABEL. `users.school` and `courses.school` are free TEXT, and every
// org-scoped query is a string comparison between them: a dean sees their college because
// `courses.school` equals the value on their account. Real institutions have been entering the
// abbreviation as the name (this deployment's only school is literally called "SOMAC"), so historic
// rows hold the short form. The instant an admin fills in the full title, a matcher that knew only
// `schools.name` would compare the long form against rows holding the short one and every scoped
// dashboard would empty out — which reads as "no data" rather than "mismatch", and is therefore the
// hardest kind of failure to diagnose.
//
// So a school reference resolves to the SET of strings that mean it, and matching accepts any.
