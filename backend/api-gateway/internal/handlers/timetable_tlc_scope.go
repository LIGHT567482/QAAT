// Who may design which department's timetable.
//
// The Teaching & Learning Centre owns the timetable. Migration 075 made that one institution-wide
// account, and one desk building every department's schedule is a bottleneck standing exactly where
// a term starts. Migration 083 puts a TLC in each department instead — the way an HOD sits in one —
// and this is the rule that makes the boundary real rather than advisory.
//
// THE SCOPE COMES FROM THE ACCOUNT, NEVER FROM THE REQUEST. A TLC does not say which department
// they are editing; their own user row says it. That is the same rule every org-scoped role in this
// system follows, and it is the whole difference between a scoped role and an unscoped one with a
// filter in the UI — a filter is a suggestion, and the request that omits it gets everything.
//
// A TLC with NO department is institution-wide. That is what every TLC account created before 083
// is, and demoting them silently on the morning of a deploy would lock the timetable's owner out of
// the timetable. It is also the right answer for an institution small enough to want one.
