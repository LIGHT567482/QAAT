// Package scheduler runs the gateway's timed jobs.
//
// The hard requirement is not "run every minute" — it is "never silently skip".
// These services are on Render's free plan and free services sleep after ~15
// minutes idle. A naive ticker wakes up, sees that it is now 14:00, fires the
// 14:00 work and never learns that 12:00 and 13:00 also needed doing. For a
// reminder system that is the worst failure mode available: the lecturer was
// promised a nudge, no nudge arrived, and nothing anywhere recorded that.
//
// So a job is not "a thing that runs now". A job is a function over a *window of
// time*, and the scheduler's contract is that every window between the last
// success and now gets passed to it exactly once. The watermark lives in
// scheduled_job_runs, so it survives a restart, a redeploy and a sleep.
//
// The price is that a job may be handed a window it has already seen (a crash
// between doing the work and moving the watermark). Jobs are therefore required
// to be idempotent, which they get from notification_log's
// UNIQUE (tenant_id, kind, subject_key, subject_date) — see MarkSent.
