// Employee attendance alerts.
//
//   not checked in    — the shift started and no clock-in was recorded
//   checked in late   — clock-in was after on-duty
//   check-out reminder— the shift is ending; don't forget to clock out
//   left early        — clock-out was before off-duty
//
// DELIVERY. The in-app inbox is the wrong channel here and only here: employees are
// non-teaching staff with no dashboard account (migration 047 — they are managed by
// the ADMIN and identified by a badge number, not a login). So these go out over
// email and WhatsApp through the notification-service, which already has both
// transports; they were simply unreachable from anything but the no-show report.
//
// TIMING. The sheet is uploaded after the fact, so "you have not checked in" cannot
// fire from it in real time. It fires from what the sheet says once uploaded, which
// is what makes it useful the following morning rather than at 08:05 — and the
// late/early alerts, which are inherently retrospective, are the ones the request
// actually turns on. The check-in/check-out reminders run on the clock instead, off
// the shift times the sheet has already established for that person.
